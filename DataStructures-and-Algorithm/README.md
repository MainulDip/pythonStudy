### Overview:
DataStructure and Algorithm in Pythons

### Algorithm:
Generally Its a set of steps or instruction for completing a task, like a recipe, etc. 

In CS, A set of (optimized) steps a program takes to finish a tasks or solve a problem. Or we can say, some better approaches (practices) to solve computation problems.

### Algorithm Guidelines:
* Algorithm clearly defines problem statement, input and output
* steps need to be in a very specific order
* steps need to distinct (consistent )
* should produce a result
* should complete in a finite amount of time

### Algorithmic Thinking:
It's the quality of solving computation problem by breaking down problems and grouping with suitable Algorithm.

### Search Algorithm:
- Linear/Sequential/Simple Search: Searching something form start position of a list/array and proceed with next until get the match.
* Binary : true (1) or false (0), either this or that
